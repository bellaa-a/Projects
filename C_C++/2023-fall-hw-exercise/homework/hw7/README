I added a function called clear(), which deletes all nodes in the current dataloop. The destructor calls this function. I wrote a separate function for it so I can call it in the + operation. I call clear() in the + operatino because it clears any existing nodes before copyping everything from the parameter. Other functions are given and follows by specified rules.

For my splice function, I used the ^ operator to shift start to where the new dataloop needs to be added, then used the ^ operator again to shift it back.
