All file handling and error are in the main function in hw5.cpp. Main would read inputs from the file, then pass the arguments necessary into the different command functions. I wrote a function for each 'a', 'd', 'c', and 'f' commands, which were all void functions because they only needed to print the output. I also wrote helper functions. Print_trigram took in a vector of tuples and printed its contents in the form specified. The boolean function greater_than returns whether or not the first parameter was greater than the second, and the boolean function larger_count returns whether the frequency of the first parameter is greater than the second. Both boolean functions are used for the third optional parameter in the sort algorithm. 

Instead of using a map, I put the frequency of each trigram as a fourth argument in each tuple. In handle_c_command, I first sorted trigram_list by descending frequency, then I sorted the ties by ASCII value in chunks, grouped by their frequency value.
